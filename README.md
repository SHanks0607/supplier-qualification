## For Abhishek


I have two issues right now. The backend at the moment is saving the suppliers with an index. This is using NGRX state management to save it to the database. 
{
0:
0:
supplierCity: "Erie"
supplierContacts: Array(1)
0:
email: "Email"
firstName: "First"
lastName: "Last"
__proto__: Object
length: 1
__proto__: Array(0)
supplierName: "Supplier"
supplierStreet: "Primrose Ct"
__proto__: Object
id: "-M9j0x-PMhdOuwv7S--o"
__proto__: Object
}
I am using a service to fetch the supplier list and I can't map the JSON file to an array properly.
